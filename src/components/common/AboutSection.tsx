I specialize in Full Stack Development, creating innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and drive business success. Recently I have been focused on improving my skills in React, TypeScript, and Node.js, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies that can help me grow as a developer. I'm learning new technologies as machine learning and AI to stay at the forefront of the industry. This complemented with certifications in Data Analysis and Cloud Computing, allows me to create robust and scalable applications.
